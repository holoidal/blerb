Story: Viewing an individual article
  As a user
  I want to view an article
  So that I can read it's contents
  
  Scenario: title for the page is the article's title
  
  Scenario: hAtom 0.1 microformat compliant
    Given there is a user
    And there is an article
    When they view the article
    Then they should see a hentry box
    And they should see an entry-title h2 within a hentry box
    And they should see a bookmark link within an entry-title h2
    And they should see a bookmark link with a "bookmark" rel
    And they should see a published paragraph within a hentry box
    And they should see an entry-content box within a hentry box
