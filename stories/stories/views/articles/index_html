Story: Viewing the homepage
  As a user
  I want to view the homepage
  So that I can see all the wonderful articles
  
  Scenario: title for the page is Latest Articles
    Given there is a user
    And there is an article
    When they view the homepage
    Then they should see a h1 containing "Latest Articles"
  
  Scenario: Homepage is hAtom 0.1 microformat compliant
    Given there is a user
    And there is an article
    When they view the homepage
    Then they should see a hentry box
    And they should see an entry-title h2 within a hentry box
    And they should see a bookmark link within an entry-title h2
    And they should see a bookmark link with a "bookmark" rel
    And they should see a published paragraph within a hentry box
    And they should see an entry-content box within a hentry box
