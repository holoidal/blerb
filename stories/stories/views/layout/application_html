  Scenario: All pages should have a title
    Given there is a user

    And they should see a page_title containing '\w+'
  
  Scenario: All pages should include the css files
    Given there is a user
    When they view any application layout based page
    Then they should see a link within the head
    And they should see a link with "text/css" type
    And they should see a link with "/stylesheets/master.css"
