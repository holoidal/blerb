Story: Viewing the signup page
  As an unregistered user
  I want to view the signup page
  So that I can register as a user
  
  Scenario: the signup form posts to the user resource
    Given there is an unregistered user
    When they view the signup page
    Then they should see a form
    And they should see a form with a "post" method
  
  Scenario: the signup form should have inputs for the user's info
    Given there is an unregistered user
    When they view the signup page
    Then they should see the form
    And they should see the user_email input within the form
    And they should see the user_password input within the form
    And they should see the user_password_confirmation input within the form
    And they should see the user_first_name input within the form
    And they should see the user_last_name input within the form
